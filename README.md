# Dratewka the Shoemaker
I created this remake as a high school project. It's entirely developed in plain javascript.
## About Dratewka the Shoemaker
"Dratewka the Shoemaker" is a text-based adventure game based on the Polish folk legend of the Wawel Dragon. The game's protagonist is a shoemaker named Dratewka, who must find a way to get rid of the evil dragon living in a cave at the foot of the Wawel Mountain, terrorizing the local inhabitants and animals. The player travels through the city and its surrounding landscape, collecting items and using them in the right places. Before the final encounter with the dragon, Dratewka must prepare sulfur-stuffed sheep. [Read more about the legend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wawel_Dragon)
